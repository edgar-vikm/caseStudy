## Who and what is Apollo Agriculture?
    Apollo Agriculture came about shortly after one of the founders (Eli pollak) left climate Corp,  where he realised  that while other countries where planting more seeds than the U.S but producing dramatically less. He later teamed up with Benjamin Ngenga to start Apollo Agriculture, with the goal and mission of helping small scale farmers in Kenya, access  the tools necessary to maximise their growth and profitabilty with the technological use of things such as Satellite imagery,  remote sensing, AI(machine learning) and automated operations.
        Apollo Agriculture raised $6 million trough series A investments done majorly trough companies such as - Anthemis Exponetial Ventures, Leaps by Bayer, and Ventures food. Apollo genereates revenue trough the sale of agricultural products such as seed and fertilizer, along with microfinancing trough their networks, where the farmers pay back in payments trough mobile banking. Since Apollo began they have worked with over 40,000 farmers, which of 25,000 merged in 2020 alone.

# New angles for Apollo AGriculture.
    With the increase in holistic approach to farming, i would bring light to "regenerative farming" which is an approach to diversify the vegetatio in ones farm, coming with a win win ratio, promoting more sustainable local climate(a stable climate decreases, drastic drought and flood patterns).
     With the growth Apollo has had and continues to have taking a step to incorporate vertical farming and the use of Bountiegel-G.
 * Why vertical farming?
   * Vertical farming is a "simple" soulution for maximising the area of farming one has, trough stacking one layer above the other in a system process.
* Why Bountiegel-G
    * the new propriteray blend known as Bountiegel-G formulated by "Aquamer" is revolutionary compound used to store and maximise the water in soil, it works as a defensive protocol for Droughts, holding in water around the root decreasin the stress put upon the plants during the irrigation process, yielding higher quality product.
